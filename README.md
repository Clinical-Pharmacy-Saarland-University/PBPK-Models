# PBPK-Models

## Purpose
This repository contains the PBPK models published by the Clinical Pharmacy Saarland University working group.
It is intended to provide the model files in their published state, meaning that all parameters should be true to the values reported in the respective publication or their Supplementary Materials.
## Disclaimer
The models presented in this repository may not always be compatible with the current version of the Open Systems Pharmacology Suite due to software changes.
However, the models are compatible with the Version reported in the respective publication.
Older releases of the Open Systems Pharmacology Suite can be found [in the OSP repository under "releases"](https://github.com/Open-Systems-Pharmacology/Suite/releases).
